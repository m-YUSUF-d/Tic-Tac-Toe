# About Adaptive Performance

Adaptive Performance allows you to get feedback about the thermal and power state of your mobile device and react appropriately. For example, you can create applications that react to temperature trends and events on the device, to ensure constant frame rates over a longer period of time and prevent thermal throttling.
