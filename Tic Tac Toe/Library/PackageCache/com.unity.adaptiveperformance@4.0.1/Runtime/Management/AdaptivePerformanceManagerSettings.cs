    /// Given a list of loaders, it will attempt to load each loader in the given order. Unity will use the first
    /// loader that is successful and ignore all remaining loaders. The successful loader
    /// is accessible through the <see cref="activeLoader"/> property on the manager.
    ///
    /// Depending on configuration, the <see cref="AdaptivePerformanceGeneralSettings"/> instance will automatically manage the active loader
    /// at the correct points in the application lifecycle. You can override certain points in the active loader lifecycle
    /// and manually manage them by toggling the <see cref="AdaptivePerformanceManagerSettings.automaticLoading"/> and <see cref="AdaptivePerformanceManagerSettings.automaticRunning"/>
    /// properties. Disabling <see cref="AdaptivePerformanceManagerSettings.automaticLoading"/> implies that you are responsible for the full lifecycle
    /// of the Adaptive Performance session normally handled by the <see cref="AdaptivePerformanceGeneralSettings"/> instance. Setting this to false also sets
    /// <see cref="AdaptivePerformanceManagerSettings.automaticRunning"/> to false.
    ///
    /// Disabling <see cref="AdaptivePerformanceManagerSettings.automaticRunning"/> only implies that you are responsible for starting and stopping
    /// the <see cref="activeLoader"/> through the <see cref="StartSubsystems"/> and <see cref="StopSubsystems"/> APIs.
    ///
    /// Unity executes atomatic lifecycle management as follows:
    ///
    /// * OnEnable calls <see cref="InitializeLoader"/> internally. The loader list will be iterated over and the first successful loader will be set as the active loader.
    /// * Start calls <see cref="StartSubsystems"/> internally. Ask the active loader to start all subsystems.
    /// * OnDisable calls <see cref="StopSubsystems"/> internally. Ask the active loader to stop all subsystems.
    /// * OnDestroy calls <see cref="DeinitializeLoader"/> internally. Deinitialize and remove the active loader.
