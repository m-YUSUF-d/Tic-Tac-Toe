# Subsytem Registration

This package `com.unity.subsystemregistration` is an internal package that will be a dependency of any newly defined "standalone" subsystem. This package will allow that subsystem to register itself with the Subsystem Manager within Unity.  This will let the Subsystem manager to keep track of the features exposed by the newly registered subsystem and provide lifecycle management for it.
